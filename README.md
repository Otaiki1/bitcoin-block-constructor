# MemPool Block Constructor

This Python script reads a mempool CSV file containing transaction data and constructs blocks based on transaction fees and weights. The constructed blocks are then written to separate text files.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python mempool_block_constructor.py
    ```

2. The script will read the mempool CSV file, construct blocks, and write the transactions of each block to separate text files (`block_sample_1.txt`, `block_sample_2.txt`, etc.).
