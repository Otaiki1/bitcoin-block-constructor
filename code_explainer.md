The provided Python script is designed to simulate the process of constructing Bitcoin blocks from a mempool of pending transactions. Here's a more technical explanation of how the script works:

- **Reading the Mempool**: The `read_mempool_csv` function reads the mempool data from a CSV file. It parses each row into a dictionary with keys for the transaction ID (`txid`), fee, weight, and parent transactions. Parent transactions are split by semicolon and stored as a list.

- **Constructing Blocks**: The `construct_block` function is the core of the script. It sorts the transactions in the mempool by their fee in descending order, which is a common approach used by miners to maximize the total fee included in a block. The function then iterates over the sorted transactions, checking if each one can be included in the current block based on the block weight limit and whether all its parent transactions are already in the block.

- **Including Transactions**: The `can_include` function is a helper function within `construct_block` that checks whether a transaction can be added to the current block. It ensures that the transaction is not already in the block and that all its parent transactions are included.

- **Managing Block Weight**: The script keeps track of the current block weight and checks if adding a new transaction would exceed the block weight limit. If it would, the current block is finalized, and a new block begins with the transaction that caused the weight limit to be exceeded.

- **Writing Blocks to Files**: Once all transactions have been processed and blocks have been constructed, the `write_blocks_to_files` function writes each block to a separate text file. Each block is written with one transaction ID per line, which is the required format for the output.

- **Main Execution**: The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the script. It reads the mempool data, constructs the blocks, and writes them to files.

The script assumes that the mempool data is provided in a CSV file with a specific format, and it does not handle any network communication or transaction broadcasting, which would be necessary for a real-world mining scenario. It also assumes that there are no coinbase transactions, which are typically included in the first transaction of a block to reward the miner.

The script's approach to block construction is a simplified version of what a miner might do in the real world. In practice, the selection of transactions would be influenced by a variety of factors, including the network's current state, the fees offered by transactions, and the miner's own preferences or strategies.
